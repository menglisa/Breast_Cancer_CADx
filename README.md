Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms To Predict Breast Cancer Diagnoses

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death from cancer in women in the United States. Early detection is strongly correlated with better prognosis. Mammography is the first line of detection, but it is not perfect. Mammography has a false negative rate of 8-10% and it is difficult to determine the severity or type of cancer, as some abnormalities do not affect the woman’s health. Therefore a biopsy is performed to confirm diagnosis. Fine-needle aspiration is the simplest and most common type of biopsy.

This study tests various supervised Machine Learning algorithms to determine which is most accurate in predicting breast cancer diagnoses with quantitative, continuous data.

The Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset was used to train and test three Machine Learning models: Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines (with and without Principal Component Analysis). Each algorithm was implemented from scratch then validated with the Python scikit-learn library.

Results: All the presented Machine Learning algorithms performed proficiently (all approximately or excceding 90% test accuracy) on predicting diagnoses. From scratch, Support Vector Machines with PCA performed the best with 98.2% accuracy, Decision Trees performed as well with an accuracy of 95.3%, and Neural Networks attained an accuracy of 89.4%.

Conclusion: Three supervised Machine Learning algorithms were implemented and compared in order to discover which performed with the highest accuracy in predicting benign versus malignant diagnoses from ​fine-needle aspiration instances. ​Support Vector Machines with PCA performed the best with an accuracy of ​98.2​%.
